- **TestSuite**
    - A specialized **CompositeTest** that represents the top-level grouping of tests, typically a single file or module.
    - May have additional metadata (e.g., file path, setup/teardown hooks).
    - Contains one or more **Tests** (CompositeTests or LeafTests).
- **Tests** (abstract concept)
    - **CompositeTest** (e.g., `describe`)
        - Has a **name**.
        - Contains child **Tests** (CompositeTests or LeafTests).
        - Does **not** have a **TestBody**.
    - **LeafTest** (e.g., `it`)
        - Has a **name**.
        - Contains a **TestBody**.
        - Does **not** have children.
- **TestBody**
    - Defines the code to execute for a leaf test.
    - Contains one or more **Expectations**, each of which checks a specific condition.
- **TestRun**
    - Represents the execution of a **Test** at a specific time.
    - Tracks **state**: `Queued` → `Running` → `Completed`.
    - Produces a **TestResult** on completion:
        - **Leaf TestResult** reflects the outcome of its `TestBody`.
        - **Composite TestResult** aggregates results of all children:
            - `Passed` if all children passed.
            - `Failed` if any child failed.
            - `Skipped` if the test or all children were skipped.
        - May include **sub-results** corresponding to child TestRuns.
- **TestResult**
    - Indicates the outcome of a test run: `Passed`, `Failed`, or `Skipped`.
    - May have **sub-results** for composite tests.
    - Can be **reported** using different strategies:
        - **Batch reporting**: all results collected and printed or sent after the run.
        - **Live reporting**: results streamed as individual tests change state (`Queued` → `Running` → `Completed`).
